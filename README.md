## Styling
BDock was using styles inside settings, which was worser. Now it's in it's own file and more customizeable.
## Multitasking
Normally BDock wasn't even supposed to show icons and was added later on. It was buggy...

If explaination at the table was too complicated, this would be more complicated so...
# Thats not enough, show me more!
